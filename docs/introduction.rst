From the MAX7301 datasheet_:

----

The MAX7301 compact, serial-interfaced I/O expander (or general-purpose I/O
(GPIO) peripheral) provides microprocessors with up to 28 ports. Each port is
individually user configurable to either a logic input or logic output.

Each port can be configured either as a push-pull logic output capable of
sinking 10mA and sourcing 4.5mA, or a Schmitt logic input with optional
internal pullup. Seven ports feature configurable transition detection logic,
which generates an interrupt upon change of port logic level. The MAX7301 is
controlled through an SPI-compatible 4-wire serial interface.
